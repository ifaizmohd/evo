# Evo Framework

Evo is a powerful and flexible JavaScript framework for building modern web applications. It is built on top of React and designed to simplify the development process while providing a comprehensive set of features for creating web apps with ease.

Evo is still in development mode, hence it is highly unstable.

## Features

- **Monorepo Architecture**: Evo uses a monorepo structure that separates the server and client packages, making it easier to manage and develop different parts of your application.

- **React-Based**: The client package is built on top of React, allowing you to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces efficiently.

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Evo supports server-side rendering, enabling faster initial page loads and improved SEO.

- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: With SSG, Evo can pre-render pages during the build process, resulting in static HTML files that can be served to clients for enhanced performance.

- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**: Evo also supports client-side rendering for dynamic content and interactions.

- **TypeScript Support**: Evo is built with TypeScript, providing enhanced code quality, better type checking, and improved developer experience.
